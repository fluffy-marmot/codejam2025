things to include in readme, random ideas:

- how a lot of python aspiring beginners are into pygame and are interested in developing simple games for
  practice, but struggle to share their games with nontechnical friends who aren't python users without having
  to package it with something like pyinstaller etc., requiring peopl to trust executables and so on. Allowing
  pygame-like functionality in the browser for simple games feels like an untapped potential. Our project
  explores the possibility of building in browser games with relatively simple usage of python, writing modular
  classes for audio handling, keyboard and mouse input, scene handling etc., which if refined with further time
  could be reusable for simple games. 

  - credits who did what on the team etc.
